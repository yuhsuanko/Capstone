# GenAI-Driven ED Admission Prediction

This repository contains the code and documentation for our UChicago Applied Data Science Capstone project:  
**"Applications of Generative AI in Emergency Department Admission Evaluation."**

## Project Overview

We develop a generative AI system to predict hospital admissions in emergency departments (EDs) at the point of triage. Our approach combines structured data (e.g., vitals, demographics) with unstructured clinical text (triage notes) using transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs). The goal is to enable real-time, context-aware predictions to support better resource allocation and reduce patient wait times.
